A short announcement: My partner [Jonathan](https://jonathanmuth.com/) and I got married! We celebrated with around 20 family members and friends and had some good food and lots of fun with them on a chilly & windy day.

Maybe the biggest change for the two of us: Jonathan and I have the same last name now, so I’m not called Lisa Charlotte Rost anymore, but ...drum roll 🥁...

**Lisa Charlotte Muth**. 

"Wait, you changed your name? Why?", I hear you asking. Well, because it's the better name. *Rost* means *Rust* in German. *Muth* is similar to the German word for *courage* (*Mut*), and gets pronounced like the English word *[moot](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/moot)*. Better sound, better meaning.

You'll still find me as Lisa Charlotte Rost online a lot, but I will slowly update my profiles in the coming days and weeks. 

[lisacharlotterost.de](https://lisacharlotterost.de/) will already redirect to lisacharlottemuth.com, and you'll find me on Twitter as [@lisacmuth](https://twitter.com/lisacmuth) instead of [@lisacrost](https://twitter.com/lisacrost). You can still reach me at [lisacharlotterost@gmail.com](mailto:lisacharlotterost@gmail.com).
