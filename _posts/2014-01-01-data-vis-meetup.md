I first attended the Data Vis Meetup Berlin on [August 25, 2014](https://www.meetup.com/data-visualization-berlin/events/202123122/), as a fresh graduate who just moved to Berlin for a job. [Francesco Occhipinti](https://www.meetup.com/members/61826062) had started it and organized it a "Monthly Visualisers Gathering" once a month in the hacker space [c.base](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XhG3RBetQBy456Xt9). Back then, everyone could present something spontenously – but most often, it was simply a nice space for people to hang out and meet other people. 

Over the next meetups, Francesco and I started talking. He was looking first for a co-organizer, and eventually for a main organizer as he moved away from Berlin a few months later. I changed the locations for the event so that more people could attend (we mostly used the Betahaus in Kreuzberg), and started inviting speakers – which attracted a bigger audience. Between summer 2015 and summer 2016, I organized the Data Vis Meetup by myself, before convincing the wonderful [Jonas Parnow](https://jonasparnow.com/) to join me. Here are some the events I organized:
