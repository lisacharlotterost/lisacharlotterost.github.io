Last Sunday, I published a data vis crossword puzzle. If you still want to try to solve it, don't continue reading! Head over to [this blog post](/dataviscrossword) and give it a go. It's fun! (At least that's what I hope.)

## The winner

And the winner of this crossword puzzle is...

🥁🥁🥁

...[Duncan Geere](@duncangeere)! The information designer solved the puzzle within 23 MINUTES (!) after me posting it. His price – a data vis book of his choice – is already on its way to his home town Gothenburg. Duncan called it ["possibly the nerdiest triumph of my life"](https://twitter.com/duncangeere/status/1359037201468846080).

A big, **big** kudos also to [Neil Richards](https://twitter.com/@theneilrichards), [Dana Wanzer](https://twitter.com/@danawanzer), [Cameron Yick](https://twitter.com/@hydrosquall), [Amelia McNamara](https://twitter.com/@AmeliaMN), [Vicky Johnson-Dahl](https://twitter.com/@hurricanevicky), Alexandra Khoo, [Colin Angus](https://twitter.com/@VictimOfMaths), [Alli Torban](https://twitter.com/@allitorban), and [Claire Santoro](https://twitter.com/@claireesantoro) for scoring 2nd to 10th place.

**[You can also download the solution here as a PDF](/pic/datavis-crossword-solutions.pdf)**. 

"But what does the clue x have to do with the correct word y?" I got you. Here are all the explantions for every single word:

## The solution, in detail – Across

**1** *– "The worst thing about bar charts is that they start at zero," he thought and got pen and paper.*<span class='kerning'> → CLEVELAND → </span>William S. Cleveland is [one of the inventors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_plot_(statistics)) of the dot plot. It's an alternative to the bar chart, except it doesn't need to start at zero.

**2** *– All the 31-Across, hated.*<span class='kerning'> → RAINBOW → </span>The clue is "All the hue(s), hated". The rainbow color scale has many hues, and many data vis practitioners and cartographers dislike them precisely because of that. [Here's an explanation by Robert Kosara.](https://eagereyes.org/basics/rainbow-color-map)

**4** *– Podcaster. (first name)*<span class='kerning'> → JON → </span>[Jon Schwabish](https://policyviz.com/about/) is the host of the PolicyViz podcast, one of the essential podcasts in the data vis scene.

**8** *– Hard to compare.*<span class='kerning'> → AREA → </span>Uh, a tricky one. Area is a visual variable that's hard to compare. For example, it's hard to compare the size of one rectangle with another one – harder than to compare two simple bars (which are encoded by length). 

**9** *– Sounds like a plant pigment; shows 50-Across results.*<span class='kerning'> → CHOROPLETH MAP → </span>"Choropleth" sounds like "Chlorophyll". Chloropleth maps often show election results.

**10** *– Captain Visualiser of Data. (last name)*<span class='kerning'> → KIRK → </span>Andy Kirk is behind [visualisingdata.com](https://www.visualisingdata.com/) – and shares the last name with Captain Kirk from Star Trek.

**13** *– Your friends and family use it, too. (Let's hope they don't use the 3D charts feature.)*<span class='kerning'> → EXCEL → </span>Excel is so widely used that it's maybe the only software with extensive data vis features that your friends and family will know. Sadly, you can also create 3D charts with it. 

**15** *– The old man leaned over his draft. He sighed. "So many of the French went, and so few came back."*<span class='kerning'> → MINARD → </span>When Charles Joseph Minard was already 88 years old – one year before his death – he designed his famous [map of Napoleon's Russian campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Joseph_Minard#The_map_of_Napoleon's_Russian_campaign). It shows that the size of Napoleon's army decreased in size drastically, mostly because of the harsh temperatures in Russia. 

**16** *– Upwards or downwards is all that counts. __ chart.*<span class='kerning'> → SLOPE → </span>Slope charts just show a general trend: Does the value go up? Or down?

**22** *– Shows correlation, not causation.*<span class='kerning'> → SCATTERPLOT → </span>Scatterplots are great to show the correlation between two variables. They don't show if one of the variables is the cause for the behavior of the other variable, though.

**27** *– "Can be everywhere a word or number can be"*<span class='kerning'> → SPARKLINE → </span>That one could be googled well! Tufte (see 36-Down) coined the term ["sparkline"](https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001OR%0A), which is a tiny line chart mid-sentence or e.g. in a tooltip and simply shows a trend. 

**29** *– "Why would I want to know where I can find the next chestnut?"*<span class='kerning'> → TREEMAP → </span>That's just a joke – a treemap neither looks like a tree nor like a map. But an actual tree map could show you where the next chestnut tree is!

**33** *– "It freaks me out." "It's random!!" "OMG please stand still. "Just show us the results."*<span class='kerning'> → JITTER → </span>When the New York Times showed a [live gauge with a jittering needle](https://flowingdata.com/2016/11/15/showing-uncertainty-during-the-live-election-forecast/) to show the US election results 2016, Twitter freaked out. The good outcome for Trump didn't help. 

**35** *– "One of these symbols means x, so five of them will mean five times x."*<span class='kerning'> → ISOTYPE → </span>Isotype is a picture language developed in the 1920s by Otto Neurath and Gerd Arntz.

There were many great discussions happening in the comments to [his blog posts](http://www.stephen-few.com/blog/2012/05/18/data-art-vs-data-visualization-why-does-a-distinction-matter/) between all the big names in the field, back when Twitter wasn't a thing.

## How to get to the ranking list

The little red numbers in the crossword lead you to this URL: 

<h2 style="color:red;margin-top:10px;">bit.ly/NLNLSERY</h2>

This link leads to a Google Form:

![](/pic/210212_crowssword3.png)

After entering your name and hitting *Submit*, you get a link to the Google Sheets ranking list:

## How it went

It went well! I think it made people happy, and that was my goal. Hopefully, it gave them a nicely spent half an hour or so.

It was not easy to solve, as people kept telling me on Twitter ("So much awesomeness. As soon as I read 21-across I heard his laugh in my head :). Definitely not easy to finish the whole thing though!" [– Justin](https://twitter.com/montanajustin/status/1358554635015913473))...but ten people made it to the ranking list, and that's even more than I thought, to be honest. 

But I underestimated how many wrong answers fit in that puzzle a bit too well. For example, the solution to 43-Down was "dashboard". But if you didn't know the answer and just guessed that the last word would be "chart", the letter no. 7 that you needed to get the right URL still would have been "R":

![part of the data vis crossword puzzle](/pic/210212_crowssword1.png)

I guess that's something to consider for future crosswords (you know, in a year or two or ten).

## Where to find more data vis crosswords

You should make one! If you had fun solving that data vis puzzle, you might be great at actually creating one. 

Alexandra Khoo, who came in 7th, created her own crossword as a reaction to the data vis crossword. [You can find it in this Google Sheets.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sPOnDskmbjWFUwXmetTiYlsZjxmfcx2YKsH-cPr6cOk/edit#gid=0) "It's themed in line with Valentine's Day with bits of dataviz inspiration thrown in," she explains in the Data Vis Society Slack.

And [Cédric Scherer](https://twitter.com/CedScherer) pointed me towards [the R-themed crosswords](https://karaman.is/tags/crossword/) by Georgios Karamanis.
