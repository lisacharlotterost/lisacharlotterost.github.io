*Edit (three hours after publishing the first version): Added the hint for 21-Down and added a number (19b) and a hint for it.* 

*Edit February 12: I posted the solution! [**Find it here.**](/dataviscrossword-solutions/)*

Yesterday morning, my partner [Jonathan](https://jonathanmuth.com/) and I solved a crossword puzzle over breakfast. We normally don't do that. Jonathan picked up a copy of "[Arts of the Working Class](http://artsoftheworkingclass.org/)", a curious, free newspaper. He likes to read the editorial â€“Â but in this issue, half the editorial had gone missing and instead, we were confronted with a crossword. And while we solved clues and put in words like "Marxism" and "Cybernetics", we were surprised about how much we actually enjoyed it. 

And I got an idea: A crossword for the data vis field! That's what the world needs! Or maybe not, but here it is anyway!

**[You can download it here as a PDF](/pic/datavis-crossword.pdf)**, then print it (it's in A4), or solve it in your favorite graphics software.

## How it works and what to win

It works mostly like a normal crossword: Solve the clues below and put in the right words, across (from left to right) and down (from top to bottom). There are two odd elements, though:

![part of the crossword showing lots of thick lines](/pic/210207_crossword1.png)

- The **thick black lines** are borders â€“ there's no connection  to the next square. For example, 12 only goes down, not across. And 13 only goes across, not down. (Yes, that's because I'm not a professional crossword designer. You'll even find words that have no connection to other words whatsoever! ðŸ˜±)
- The data vis field has some looong words. I split them up. The **red lines** show you where one part of the word (or name) ends and where the next one begins. The direction (down or across) always stays the same. For example, 1â€“Across goes five letters across and then continues in row three with four more letters. The clues have a 
"split up" hint if they are split up like this.

The squares with the red number in the lower-right (in the example above, you can see the 1 in the third row and third column) will give you the eight letters in the right order that you need to enter the ranking list, like so:

<h2 style="color:red;margin-top:10px;">bit.ly/_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _</h2>

(The letters are uppercase in the URL! Also, it's not a phrase that makes sense. I don't like these crossword puzzles where you only need to solve half of the solution to guess the rest.)

This URL will lead to a **Google survey**. Put your name in there, and you'll get the link to the Google survey results â€“Â which will be the ranking! 

Let's make that a bit more competitive: If you're the first to put your name on that ranking, I'll get in touch with you and you'll receive ðŸŽ‰ **a data vis book of your choice** ðŸŽ‰ (50 Euro or less incl. shipping). If you don't want a book, you can tell me and I'll give it to the 2nd place, and then 3rd place, etc.

Here are the clues:

The quotes are not original except one, 27-Across. 

## Some more hints (= very light spoilers)

The crossword reveals 13 vis types, five tools, 14 people, and 22 concepts from the field of data visualization. **If you can't figure out a word, this list might help:**

**Visualization types:** 9-Across, 16-Across, 22-Across, 27-Across, 29-Across, 39-Across, 41-Across, 52-Across, 6-Down, 7-Down, 16-Down, 32-Down, 47-Down

**Tools** (not necessarily pure data vis tools): 13-Across, 40-Across, 2-Down, 25-Down, 45-Down

**People** (current and historical ones): 1-Across
4-Across, 10-Across, 15-Across, 18-Across, 21-Across, 49-Across, 1-Down, 3-Down, 24-Down, 28-Down, 34-Down, 36-Down, 38-Down

**Concepts** (e.g. data visualization elements): 2-Across, 8-Across, 20-Across, 26-Across, 30-Across, 31-Across, 32-Across, 33-Across, 35-Across, 44-Across, 46-Across, 51-Across, 5-Down, 11-Down, 12-Down, 14-Down, 17-Down, 19-Down, 23-Down, 37-Down, 43-Down, 46-Down


## Sooo...how easy is it to solve?

I hope there are some words that are easy to solve for everyone with an interest in data visualization. If you want to solve all of them, you'll probably need to follow some data vis people on Twitter, have read a data vis book or three and have gone to a data vis conference. 

I don't normally solve crossword puzzles. And I never designed one. So when writing the clues, I wasn't sure if they're too hard or to easy. I erred on the side of "too hard", to make it a challenge for you all â€“Â and to give you some chance to collaborate! **Ask around on Twitter, or find somebody to solve that puzzle with (I'm happy to send two books a 25 Euro, too).**

## Where's the solution? 

~~It's not online yet. I'll post it in a week or so!~~ <br>[**Here's the solution**](/dataviscrossword-solutions/).
