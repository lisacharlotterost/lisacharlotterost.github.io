## What I've done with my life so far

I help others to create better data visualizations. Currently I'm doing so at [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/), a data visualization tool based in Berlin, mostly by writing [longer](https://blog.datawrapper.de/category/datavis-dos-and-donts/) pieces for the [Datawrapper Blog](https://blog.datawrapper.de/). I work four days a week and enjoy my free time on the fifth one and freelance a bit on the side.

Before 2021, I was called Lisa Charlotte Rost. Then I married [Jonathan Muth](https://jonathanmuth.com/) and [took his name](https://lisacharlottemuth.com/muth).

Before joining Datawrapper in 2017, I created data visualizations for newsrooms like Bloomberg, Tagesspiegel, SPIEGEL, NPR (as part of a Knight-Mozilla OpenNews Fellowship) and ZEIT Online. In 2014, I graduated with a Master's degree in visual communication after six years of studying in Weimar, Toronto and Oxford.

I care about the data vis community. In 2015, I took over the [Data Vis Meetup Berlin](https://www.meetup.com/Data-Visualization-Berlin/events/). Before the pandemic, my co-host Jonas Parnow and I organized it almost monthly. Also in 2015, I tried my hands at teaching data vis at several universities in Germany. In 2018 and as part of my job at Datawrapper, I started organizing the [Data Vis Book Club](https://twitter.com/datavisclub). It's a global & digital book club that focuses on Data Vis books from authors like Cairo, Tufte, Munzner and Cole-Nussbaumer. [(Have a look at the books we've read so far.)](https://blog.datawrapper.de/tags/bookclub/)

### &rarr;  Lunch
(Paused for pandemic reasons) I live in Berlin. If you do so, too, or are in town for a visit, let's do lunch! Datawrapper is based in Prenzlauer Berg (close to Helmholtzplatz) with lots of lunch options around. I'm happy to chat over some good food.

<h2 style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 5px;">"If you *ever* make charts as part of your job (or hobby), and you don't follow Lisa and everything she writes, you're sabotaging yourself."</h2>

<h2 style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 5px;">"Sifting quickly through @infobeautyaward's shortlist: the highlight of the year for me is hands down the @Datawrapper's <a href="https://blog.datawrapper.de/">blog</a> and Lisa's awesome writings."</h2>
